# gamedev_log

01.04.2025 

Starting to work on a couple of gamedev projects, will keep it updated.

Spent the past week creating a sample project on Game maker, a clone of a mobile infinite jumper game.
Successful.
Going to polish it and then move to Unity.

02.04.2025 

Additional testing showed space for improvements in balance and QoL, spent the day working on that

03.04.2025

Got ideas for additional content and new mechanics for enemies and character options. Started by drawing all the necessary sprites.
The animation work took sometime

04.04.2025

Sprite work mostly done, added new mechanics, tested them, adjusted, tested again, gathered some opinion from testers

05.04.2025

QoL improvements, then sent the new version for playtesting. In the meantime studied Unity tutorials and did some practice.

06.04.2025

More spritework and content expansions added. The game is nearing a state where I can release it as an actual project rather than a simple exercise.

07.04.2025

More spritework, more QoL, more blackbox testing to cover as many potential use cases as possible. Also more studying.
Switching from Game Maker to Unity is a difficulty spike.
